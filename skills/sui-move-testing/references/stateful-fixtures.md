# Stateful Move Test Fixtures

Apply these rules when tests use `test_scenario`, span transactions, or need to
move and later recover non-copyable state.

Use small, ability-free hot-potato fixtures:

- Create one fixture type per setup family and name it for what it provides.
- Store the `Scenario` plus only the objects that family uses.
- Use `Option<T>` fields only for consuming or replacement flows.
- Hide option access behind `take_*`, `replace_*`, or `retake_*` helpers.
- Provide one uniquely named `start_*` function for all setup choreography.
- Provide one consuming `<fixture>_end` function that returns or destroys every
  object and ends the scenario.
- Provide a receiver-style `<fixture>_next_tx!` macro that advances sender and
  passes one named fixture handle to the closure.
- Provide a fixture `ctx!` macro as the only transaction-context access in test
  bodies.
- Alias helpers with `use fun helper as Fixture.method`, especially when several
  fixture types exist.
- Put fixture macros, setup, and helpers in titled sections after the tests,
  using the repository's section vocabulary. Never interleave helpers with
  tests.
- Limit test bodies to starts, transaction macros, fixture methods and field
  reads, assertions, and one `end`.
- Never touch `test_scenario`, the scenario field, context internals, or fixture
  `Option` internals directly in a test body.
