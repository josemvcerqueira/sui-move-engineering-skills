# Upgrade and Dependency Tests

Apply these rules when publication, package upgrades, state migration,
operational activation, dependency relinking, external ABI validation, or
adapter fingerprinting is in scope.

- Test correct and incorrect `Publisher`, `UpgradeCap`, package, digest,
  receipt, and policy transitions.
- Prove module initializers do not rerun on upgrade. When operational activation
  exists, test old-version rejection and explicit migration or activation
  authority.
- Run compatibility checks that reject incompatible changes to existing public
  function signatures, struct or enum layouts, or abilities while accepting
  permitted generic-constraint relaxation.
- Test the active `UpgradeCap` policy and an authorized new-type migration when
  stored shape must change.
- For every version-gated cross-package seam, test that a dependent linked to
  the previous generation is rejected after activation and that the accepted
  relink or retirement path remains live.
- Verify an adapter against deployed external ABI, not only local link stubs.
- Fail closed on missing, null, duplicate, unknown, or added ABI fields that
  change consumed semantics. Review harmless additive fields before updating a
  fingerprint.
- Detect mutable dependency selectors, wrong repositories, wrong
  subdirectories, edge rebinding, and lockfile drift.
- Review a new external revision before updating a committed fingerprint.
